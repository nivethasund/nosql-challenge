## Module 12 Challenge Files

This repo contains the following files,
- The Resources directory containing the establishments.json file.
- The NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb jupyter notebook that I've used to set up and update the uk_food database, as the first part of this assignment.
- The NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb jupyter notebook that I've used to begin an analysis of the 'establishments' collection within the uk_food database.

## East Safe, Love

In this challenge, I use my knowledge of MongoDB as well as its related Python library PyMongo to run an analysis on various establishments across the United Kingdom. I've analyzed my database by filtering through our JSON file to gather data based on Hygiene scores and the overall Rating Value of these establishments.

By using various MongoDB functions such as aggregate pipelines and grouping, I've answered a set of questions in the analysis starter file and also rendered these findings in the form of a Pandas DataFrame.
